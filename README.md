Cameras are omipresent today, and we as users flood the social media space with pictures of us with our lives. 
PIXELATE applies facial detection and pixelates the faces it detects selectively or all.

***
The objectives of this project are the following 
1. Promote privacy, and prevent un-intended facial recognition 
2. Develop a camera which apply pixelate as soon as the image is generated, again to promote privacy. 
3. Allow cameras to be used in homes and other places where the objective might be to detect human presence but not really to identify who is in the image.
